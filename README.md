# Reinforcement Learning for Stock Trading

## Overview

This repository contains a simple implementation of a reinforcement learning algorithm using the Q-learning approach to formulate a basic stock trading strategy. The code is written in Python and utilizes the OpenAI Gym library for creating a custom trading environment.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install gym numpy
```

## Usage

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Define your stock data as a pandas DataFrame in the `data` variable.
   - Adjust parameters such as initial capital, maximum shares to hold, etc., in the `StockTradingEnv` class if needed.

2. **Running the Code:**
   - Execute the script ` Q-learning-algorithm.py`.

3. **Understanding the Code:**
   - The `StockTradingEnv` class defines the custom trading environment.
   - Q-learning is used to update the Q-values based on the Bellman equation.
   - The script runs a specified number of episodes, printing the total reward for each episode.

4. **Customization:**
   - Customize the code for your specific dataset, trading strategy, or reinforcement learning algorithm.
   - Tweak hyperparameters, such as learning rate and discount factor, for optimal performance.
